# URL-Shortner
This screen will have an input box where a user can enter a url and generate a 5 character short code for that. The structure of the short url would be http://APP_URL/SHORTCODE  For example, lets say the user enters https://dltlabs.com/ &lt;URL>. The system will generate a random code &lt;CODE> and store it corresponding to the URL. Now if someone opens http://APP_URL/CODE the system will redirect that person to https://dltlabs.com/. Before redirecting the user, the system will store the following information about each visit - Timestamp - OS - Browser - IP Address
